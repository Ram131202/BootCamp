                <p class="content">
                    Space is completely silent. There’s no air or atmosphere, so sound waves have no medium to travel through. Even if you were to shout at the top of your lungs, no one would hear you in space! However, radio waves (electromagnetic waves) can still travel through the void, which is why astronauts use radios for communication during space missions.<br>

                    The hottest planet in our solar system is Venus. With an average surface temperature of about 232°F (450°C), it’s a true inferno. Surprisingly, Venus isn’t the closest planet to the Sun—Mercury holds that title. But Venus’s thick atmosphere traps heat, making it scorching hot.</br>

                    A full NASA spacesuit costs a whopping $12 million! About 70% of that cost is for the backpack and control module. These high-tech suits allow astronauts to survive in the harsh vacuum of space. Interestingly, NASA still uses some suits made back in 1974.<br>
